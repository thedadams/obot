# FAQ

## Onboarding & Setup

### Should I use Docker or Kubernetes for production?

Docker is suitable for local testing and small-scale deployments. For production, especially in enterprise settings, Kubernetes is recommended for high availability, resource management, and upgrades.

### Why can’t I see the User Management section?

User Management is only visible when authentication is enabled. Make sure you start Obot with `OBOT_SERVER_ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION=true`. If you don't see the bootstrap token prompt, the environment variable may not be set correctly. Follow the [installation guide](./installation/enabling-authentication.md).

### How do I assign roles to users before they log in?

Currently, users must log in at least once before roles can be assigned. To pre-assign admin roles, set the `OBOT_SERVER_AUTH_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable during deployment. 

### What are the differences between the open source and enterprise versions of Obot?

Both use the same core codebase, but the enterprise version includes additional closed-source plugins for:

- enterprise authentication (Entra, Okta) 
- model providers (Azure OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock)

## Integration & Troubleshooting

### How do I connect my IDE or MCP client to an Obot hosted MCP server?

<details>
<summary>Step-by-step instructions</summary>

1. Go to the **MCP Servers** page in the left navigation
2. Click on the server you want to connect to
3. Click **Connect to Server**
4. If the server requires configuration or authentication, fill that out and click **Launch**
5. A connection modal will appear with the connection URL and configuration snippets for popular MCP clients

### Why does my IDE/client (e.g., Cline) fail to connect to Obot with a "Session ID is required" error?

Some clients do not support the required OAuth flows. As a workaround, use the `mcp-remote` package as a proxy, or check for client updates that add OAuth support.

### Why do I get a "cannot determine MCP server, resource parameter required" error when my MCP client connects?

This error means your MCP client did not include the OAuth `resource` parameter when authorizing the connection. Obot requires this parameter because it identifies which MCP server the user is trying to connect to. Without it, Obot cannot determine the target server or enforce access control, so the OAuth flow will not work.

For Codex, you can specify the OAuth `resource` parameter by passing the `--oauth-resource` flag, set to the same value as your MCP server URL:

```
codex mcp add --url <MCP_SERVER_URL> --oauth-resource <MCP_SERVER_URL> <SERVER_NAME>
```

Make sure the `--oauth-resource` value matches the `--url` value exactly.

For other clients that don't support specifying the OAuth `resource` parameter, you can create an [agent authorization scope](./functionality/agent-auth-scopes.md) and use its API key instead of the OAuth flow. For more context, see the related [Codex CLI issue](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/13891).

## Enterprise Access

### How do I request an enterprise trial or proof-of-concept?

- Contact the Obot team directly on Discord, Website, or email.

## Miscellaneous

### How do I pass user-specific parameters (e.g., Jira PAT tokens) to a remote MCP server?

As an admin, you can configure the server in the MCP Servers section. See [MCP Servers](./functionality/mcp-servers.md) for details.

### How do I get started with AKS/GKE/AWS deployment?

See the reference architecture guide for your cloud provider, and follow the Kubernetes installation.

- [AKS](./installation/reference-architectures/03-azure-aks.md)
- [GKE](./installation/reference-architectures/01-gcp-gke.md)
- [AWS](./installation/reference-architectures/02-aws-eks.md)
