# Obot Configuration Reference

The Obot server is configured via environment variables. The following configuration is available:

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | The foundation of Obot is a large language model that supports function-calling. The default is OpenAI and specifying an OpenAI key here will ensure none of the users need to worry about specifying their own API key. | - |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | You can also provide an Anthropic API key in place of or in addition to an OpenAI API key. | - |
| `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` | Obot makes heavy use of repositories hosted on GitHub. Care is taken to cache these and only re-check when necessary. However, rate-limiting can happen. Setting a read-only token here can alleviate many of these issues. No grants are required for either a 'classic' or 'fine-grained' token to access public repos (read-only). If you want to give the token access to private repos, you will need to give it `repo` (for a 'classic' token) or `contents (read-only)` and `metadata (read-only)`. |
| `OBOT_SERVER_DSN` | Obot uses a database backend. By default, it will use a sqlite3 local database when running the plan Obot binary. The Obot container will use an internal PostgreSQL database (not recommended for production). This environment variable allows you to specify another database option. For example, you can use a postgres database with something like `OBOT_SERVER_DSN=postgres://user:password@host/database`. | - |
| `OBOT_SERVER_HOSTNAME` | Tell Obot what its server URL is so that things like OAuth, LLM proxying, and invoke URLs are handled correctly. | - |
| `OBOT_SERVER_DAILY_USER_INPUT_TOKEN_LIMIT` | The maximum number of prompt/input tokens allowed per user per day. Set to a negative value to disable this limit. | `10000000` |
| `OBOT_SERVER_DAILY_USER_OUTPUT_TOKEN_LIMIT` | The maximum number of completion/output tokens allowed per user per day. Set to a negative value to disable this limit. | `100000` |
| `OBOT_SERVER_IDLE_AGENT_SHUTDOWN_HOURS` | The interval in hours to check for idle agents and shut them down. Set to `-1` to disable idle shutdown. | `72` (3 days) |
| `OBOT_SERVER_SINGLE_USER_IDLE_SERVER_SHUTDOWN_HOURS` | The interval in hours to check for idle single-user MCP servers and shut them down. Set to `-1` to disable idle shutdown. | `24` (1 day) |

| `OBOT_SERVER_AUTHENTICATED_RATE_LIMIT` | Rate limit for authenticated non-admin requests (requests per second). Authenticated requests are tracked by user ID. Admin users are exempt from rate limiting. | `200` |

Tri-state: `true` force-enables them regardless of existing data, `false` force-disables them even if agents already exist, and when unset Obot enables them only if the deployment already has at least one agent. New deployments therefore start with Obot Agent disabled, while existing deployments that already use agents stay enabled across upgrades with no migration required. The effective value is resolved once at server startup. | unset |

A SkillRepository resource will be created from this URL and synced automatically. | `https://github.com/obot-platform/skills` |
