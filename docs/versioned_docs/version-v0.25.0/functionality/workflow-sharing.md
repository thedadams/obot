# Workflow Sharing

:::note
Workflows are an [Obot Agent](../concepts/obot-agent.md) feature, which is disabled by default for new deployments. To enable it, set the `OBOT_ENABLE_AGENTS=true` environment variable on the server. See the [configuration reference](../configuration/server-configuration.md) for details.
:::

Workflow sharing lets users publish a workflow from Obot Agent so it can be discovered and installed by other users as a reusable starting point.

This feature is designed for sharing complete workflow packages, not just a single markdown file. When a workflow is published, Obot stores the workflow's `SKILL.md` plus every other file in the workflow directory.

## How It Works

Each published workflow has:

- A stable artifact ID
- A workflow name taken from the `SKILL.md` frontmatter
- A generated display name based on that workflow name
- A version history
- A subject list on each version controlling access

Publishing the same workflow name again as the same user creates a new version of the existing published workflow instead of creating a separate entry.

Two different users can publish workflows with the same name. They will be stored as separate published workflows with different IDs.

## Publishing a Workflow

Workflow sharing is exposed through the workflow tools available to Obot Agent's Nanobot integration.
To publish a workflow, simply ask the agent to publish it.

When publishing succeeds:

- The first publish creates version `1`
- Republishing the same workflow creates version `2`, `3`, and so on
- The published package includes the entire workflow directory
- Version `1` starts owner-only, with no additional subjects
- New versions inherit the previous version's subject list until you change it

## Discovering Shared Workflows

Agents also have a tool that they can use to search for published workflows.

Search matches against:

- The workflow name
- The generated display name
- The workflow description

Search results include the workflow ID, name, display name, description, the latest version you can access, version summaries for the versions you can access, and author email when available.

## Installing a Shared Workflow

Agents have a tool to install workflows that they found using the search tool.

Installation behavior:

- Installing without a version downloads the latest version you can access
- Installing with a version downloads that specific version
- The workflow is extracted into `workflows/<name>/`
- If a local workflow with the same name already exists, the user is asked to confirm the overwrite
- After installation, the workflow is immediately available for use

:::note
The current install flow relies on the runtime having `unzip` available and does not support Windows-based runtimes.

## Access and Subjects

Published workflows use version-specific subjects to control access.

For each published version:

- Empty subject list: only the workflow owner and admins can view or download that version
- Specific `user` subjects: only those users can access that version
- Specific `group` subjects: members of those groups can access that version
- `selector:*`: all authenticated Obot users can discover and install that version

:::note
The workflow owner and all users with Admin or Owner roles can download the workflow, regardless of the subjects that are selected.
:::

Published workflows start with an empty subject list on version `1` by default. In Obot Agent, sharing is managed from the published workflow details UI by editing the subject list for a selected version. The UI supports individual users, groups, and `All Obot Users`.

Access rules are enforced on the Obot side:

- Search results include workflows for which you can access at least one version, plus your own owner-only workflows
- For non-owners, the reported latest version is the newest version whose subjects match you
- Owners and admins can see every version of a published workflow
- Workflows and versions with non-matching subjects are hidden from other users
- Only the owner or an admin can change sharing, edit metadata, or delete a published workflow

## Versioning

Versioning is per workflow name and per publisher.

That means:

- Your first publish of `code-review` is version `1`
- Republishing your `code-review` workflow creates version `2`
- Another user publishing their own `code-review` workflow creates a separate published workflow with its own version history

Older versions remain downloadable by version number as long as the published workflow still exists.

## Operational Requirements

Workflow sharing depends on storage being available for published workflow ZIP files.

### Published Workflow Storage

Obot stores published workflows separately from workspace files.

If you do not configure a cloud storage provider, Obot falls back to local disk storage under its data directory. That is acceptable for local development and single-node testing, but it is not recommended for highly available or ephemeral deployments.

For production, configure one of the supported storage providers for published workflows:

| Provider | Required Settings |
|----------|-------------------|
| `s3` | `OBOT_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_S3_REGION` |
| `custom` | `OBOT_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=custom`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_S3_ENDPOINT`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_S3_REGION`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` |
| `gcs` | `OBOT_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=gcs`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_BUCKET`, optionally `OBOT_ARTIFACT_GCS_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` |
| `azure` | `OBOT_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_PROVIDER=azure`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_STORAGE_BUCKET`, `OBOT_ARTIFACT_AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT`, and Azure identity settings if not using default credentials |

Provider-specific behavior:

- `s3` can use ambient AWS credentials or explicit access keys
- `custom` is for S3-compatible systems such as MinIO or Cloudflare R2
- `gcs` can use Application Default Credentials or an inline service account JSON document
- `azure` can use default Azure credentials or explicit client credentials

## Deployment Guidance

For Docker or single-node development:

- The default local artifact store is usually sufficient
- Keep Obot's data volume persistent if you want shared workflows to survive container replacement

For Kubernetes or multi-replica production:

- External object storage is the recommended production option
- If you do not want object storage, keep the chart's `persistence` PVC enabled because it mounts `/data`, which includes `/data/.local/share/obot/published-artifacts`
- Use `ReadWriteOnce` only for a single Obot replica
- Use `ReadWriteMany` for multi-replica Obot deployments so every replica can access the same artifact files
- Treat published workflow storage the same way you treat other persistent user-generated platform data
