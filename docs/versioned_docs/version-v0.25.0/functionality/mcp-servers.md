description: Managing MCP servers in the MCP Platform

## Overview

Managing MCP servers in Obot starts with adding them to the platform. Administrators can control which servers are available to users and how they are configured. Servers may be added individually through the UI, or managed via a Git repository.

The choice of server type depends on how the MCP server was developed. All servers that are not remote servers are deployed and managed by the MCP Gateway.

## Server types

The system supports four distinct server types, each designed for specific deployment scenarios:

### Single-user server

Single-user servers establish a one-to-one mapping between users and server instances. Each user has their own server instance deployed and provides their own individual credentials (such as personal API keys). Most `stdio` servers were designed with this model in mind. The intended use was to run on the individual's laptop.

This model provides maximum isolation and is ideal when:

- Users need to connect with their personal accounts (e.g., individual GitHub tokens)
- Security policies require user-level credential isolation
- Different users need different configurations or permissions

Keep in mind the gateway will deploy these servers in their own environment on a hosted platform. MCP servers that expect local access to the users filesystem, run local executables, or write output to the local disk will not work as expected.

By default, Obot also blocks MCP servers from connecting to `localhost` addresses, private IP addresses, or link-local addresses. Administrators can opt out with `OBOT_SERVER_DISALLOW_LOCALHOST_MCP=false`, `OBOT_SERVER_DISALLOW_PRIVATE_IPMCP=false`, or `OBOT_SERVER_DISALLOW_LINK_LOCAL_MCP=false`, but should only do so when the server is expected to reach services inside the Obot runtime environment.

**Configuration**: Define parameters that users must provide when enabling the server (e.g., API keys). For each parameter, specify a user-friendly name, description, environment variable name, and whether it's required or sensitive. Values are passed as environment variables to the server process.

### Multi-user server

Multi-user servers address organizational deployment patterns through two primary configurations:

1. **Shared credentials**: Organizations provide centralized credentials (e.g., a weather API key) that all users can leverage
2. **Self-authenticating servers**: Servers that handle OAuth or multi-tenancy internally, enabling secure multi-user access

This approach is optimal when:

- The organization owns shared service accounts or API keys
- You want to simplify user onboarding by eliminating individual setup
- The service supports organizational or tenant-based access
- Usage monitoring and control at the organizational level is important

Multi-user servers still require the user to authenticate to the gateway's configured identity provider.

**Configuration**: Pre-configure any required API keys or environment variables. These values are deployed with the server instance. Users connect without being prompted for configuration and authenticate using the built-in authentication or OAuth per the MCP specification.

### Multi-user catalog entry

A multi-user catalog entry can be deployed as a shared multi-user server. Instead of creating one server per user when users connect, Obot creates a shared deployment from the catalog entry and then creates per-user MCP server instances for the users who connect to that deployment.

Use a multi-user catalog entry when:

- Administrators or Power User+ users should publish an approved multi-user server configuration before it is deployed
- Different workspaces or catalogs need their own shared deployment from the same catalog entry
- The shared server may need deployment-level configuration, such as a URL, shared API key, or environment variables
- Individual users still need per-user headers or authentication after connecting to the shared deployment

Multi-user catalog entries are configured with `serverUserType: multiUser`. Admin and Power User+ users can deploy them as multi-user servers.

Catalog entry updates are tracked against deployed servers. When a catalog entry changes, affected deployments show an update action and a diff of the current deployed manifest versus the updated catalog entry. Applying the update refreshes the shared deployment from the catalog entry. Users may need to reconfigure their own instance if the update introduces new required per-user configuration.

Multi-user catalog entries do not support the composite runtime. To build a composite server that includes a multi-user server, deploy the multi-user catalog entry first and then add that deployed server as a component of the composite server.

### Remote server

MCP Servers that are HTTP Streaming compatible should be configured this way. These servers can be provided by trusted 3rd party vendors. Remote servers also work for MCP servers deployed through existing CI/CD pipeline within the organization.

Choose this type when:

- You have MCP services deployed through traditional application deployment mechanisms
- External partners provide MCP endpoints and you just want to integrate
- You are building MCP servers through existing CI/CD workflows or SaaS services

Remote MCP servers that conform to the MCP spec authentication schema will work out of the box. Servers that do not conform to the spec may not work within the gateway. Please open a GitHub issue if you run into issues with remote servers.

**Configuration**: Specify the remote URL endpoint. Additional options include connection restrictions for unconventional configurations, custom HTTP headers, and configuration values to send to the remote server.

If Obot cannot directly reach a remote server, use an [MCP Tunnel](./mcp-tunnels.md) to route requests through a machine on the server's network. Keep the remote server's real HTTP or HTTPS URL and select the tunnel separately in **Advanced Configuration**.

### Composite server

Composite servers let administrators combine one or more single-user, multi-user, and remote servers into a single virtual MCP server. It also allows admins to control the names, descriptions, and availability of the tool set exposed to end-users.

This type is useful when:

- You want a single connection endpoint that aggregates tools from multiple servers
- You need fine-grained tool RBAC without exposing entire servers
- You want to fine-tune exposed tool names and descriptions
- You want to create tool sets tailored to specific user groups and use cases

**Configuration**: Inherited from component servers. Users are prompted for configuration for each component and can disable individual components. Remote components requiring OAuth prompt for authentication, and skipping OAuth automatically disables that component.

## Adding a server

Navigate to **MCP Management > MCP Servers** in the MCP Platform, then select **Add MCP Server**.

Select the type of server you want to deploy.

## Basic configuration

All server types require the same basic identifying information:

- **Name and description**: Provide a clear name and description to help users understand the server's purpose
- **Icon URL**: Optionally specify an icon URL to improve visual identification in the user interface
- **Categories/tags**: Add optional categorization to facilitate server discovery and filtering

## Runtime selection

Single-user and multi-user servers require runtime environment configuration. Remote servers skip this section since they connect to existing deployments.

Select the appropriate runtime environment based on your server's requirements:

### NPX: Node/Typescript Based MCP Servers

If you found an MCP server like Firecrawl and want to add it to the MCP Gateway you would do the following.

From the README.md:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "firecrawl-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "firecrawl-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "YOUR-API-KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the MCP Gateway

- You would select NPX from the drop down.
- Then put `firecrawl-mcp` in the package text box.

For single-user setup, you would add User supplied configuration

- Name: Firecrawl API Key
- Description: The api key for Firecrawl
- Key: FIRECRAWL_API_KEY

In this case you would select `required` and `sensitive` options as well.

For multi-user setup, you would follow the same steps but would be configuring this to **SHARE** a common API key with ALL users.

### UVX: For Python-based packages  

If you found an MCP server like Duckduckgo and want it added to the gateway you would do the following.

From the README.md:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "ddg-search": {
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": ["duckduckgo-mcp-server"]
        }
    }
}
```

In the gateway you would:

- Select UVX from the drop down
- In the package field put in `duckduckgo-mcp-server`

If environment variables need to be configured, you would use the user or multi-user configuration to supply or prompt for the values.

### Containerized: For Docker-based deployments

If you want to provide a container to run your MCP server because you are running a non-TypeScript or Python MCP server you must configure it to run as either Streaming HTTP or SSE.

You will need to select the container option from the drop down. Then provide the following bits of info:

- Image: The uri of the OCI image. (ex. docker.elastic.co/mcp/elasticsearch)
- Port: port the MCP server will be listening on inside the container.
- Path: the URI path. (typically /MCP or /SSE)
- Command: primary command to execute
- Arguments: arguments to pass to the command.

You can also provide configuration through environment variables by filling in the configurations.

## Kubernetes Secret Bindings

MCP secret bindings let Admins select a key from an externally managed Kubernetes Secret as the value source for a multi-user MCP deployment configuration field.

Secret bindings are available only when Obot is using the Kubernetes MCP runtime backend.

### Required Kubernetes Secret Label

Secret binding selection in the admin UI is available for multi-user MCP deployments. The Kubernetes Secret must be in the Obot server's namespace and must have the [configured allowed secret-binding label](../configuration/server-configuration.md).

The label controls whether a Secret can be discovered and selected in the admin UI, and Obot also checks the label when resolving the binding at runtime. If the label is removed after an MCP server is already bound to that Secret, the binding is treated as unavailable. Required fields then appear as missing configuration until the label is restored or the binding is changed.

Secrets without data keys are not shown as bindable targets.

### Configure a Binding in the Admin UI

#### New Catalog Entry
1. Go to **MCP Management > MCP Catalog**.
2. Use "Add Catalog Entry" to create a new Hosted Server (Multi-tenant)
3. Add a configuration value or header.
4. In **Value Source**, select **Kubernetes Secret**.
5. Select the Secret name and key.
6. Save the MCP server.

#### Git-ops Managed Template
1. Go to **MCP Management > MCP Catalog**.
2. Locate a multi-user template created from a Git source
3. Click "Connect URL" to launch a new deployment
4. In **Value Source**, select **Kubernetes Secret**.
5. Select the Secret name and key.
6. Save the MCP server.

## Post-deployment management

After successfully adding a server:

- The server appears in the available servers list for authorized users
- Server entries can now be added to authorization groups for different teams
- Users can integrate the server into their clients to access tools in conversations and tasks
- Administrative monitoring of usage and auditing is available through the MCP Platform
