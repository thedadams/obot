# Auth Providers

Authentication providers allow your Obot installation to authenticate users with the identity provider of your choice.
Administrators must configure at least one authentication provider before users can log in.
Multiple providers can be configured and available for login at the same time.

:::note
In order for authentication to be enabled, the Obot server must be run with the environment variable set:

`OBOT_SERVER_ENABLE_AUTHENTICATION=true`.
:::

## Setting up Authentication

### Bootstrap Token

When launching Obot for the first time, the server will print a randomly generated bootstrap token to the console.

:::info
When installing via Helm, this token is saved inside a kubernetes secret `<helm install name>-config`.
:::

This token can be used to authenticate as an admin user in the UI.
You will then be able to configure authentication providers.
Bootstrap login remains available until at least one authentication provider is configured and at least one non-bootstrap owner user exists.
Once both are true, the bootstrap token will no longer be valid.

:::tip Custom Bootstrap Token
You can use the `OBOT_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` environment variable to provide a specific value for the token,
rather than having one generated for you. If you do this, the value will **not** be printed to the console.

Obot will persist the value of the bootstrap token on its first launch (whether randomly generated or
supplied by `OBOT_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN`), and all future server launches will use that same value.
`OBOT_BOOTSTRAP_TOKEN` can always be used to override the stored value.
:::

### Preconfiguring Owner & Admin Users

If you want to preconfigure owner or admin users, you can set the `OBOT_SERVER_AUTH_OWNER_EMAILS` or `OBOT_SERVER_AUTH_ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable, respectively.
This is a comma-separated list of email addresses that will be granted owner or admin access when they log in,
regardless of which auth provider they used. Email matching is case-insensitive.

Users can be given the administrator role by other owners or admins in the Users section of the UI.
Users whose email addresses are in configured list will automatically have the administrator role,
and the role cannot be revoked from them.

Similarly, users can be given the owner role by other owners in the Users section of the UI.
Users whose email addresses are in configured list will automatically have the owner role,
and the role cannot be revoked from them.

## Access Control

### Restricting Access by Email Domain

All authentication providers support restricting access to specific email domains, using the "Email Domains" field in the configuration UI.

You can:

- Use `*` to allow all email domains
- Specify a comma-separated list of domains to restrict access

**Example:** `example.com,example.org` would only allow users with email addresses ending in `example.com` or `example.org`.

## Available Auth Providers

Obot supports the built-in [Local](#local) provider, as well as the following providers that authenticate against an external identity provider using OAuth2. For the OAuth2 providers, you will need to follow the instructions in the auth provider for setting up a new app before getting started. You can get the callback URL from the Obot Admin -> Auth Providers -> \<Auth Provider> -> Configure page. The configuration form will also have fields for the data required.

### Local

The Local provider authenticates users with an email address and password stored in Obot's own database. It requires no external identity provider, which makes it a good fit for evaluations, air-gapped installations, and small deployments.

Passwords are hashed with [argon2id](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) and are never stored, logged, or returned by the API.

To set it up:

1. Go to Admin -> Auth Providers and configure the **Local** provider, setting the email domains that local users are allowed to have (`*` allows any domain).
2. Click the **Manage Users** button on the Local provider card, and create a user. Share the password with them over a secure channel.
3. Local users sign in from the Obot login page by choosing **Local**, then entering their email and password.

:::note
Local users cannot change their own password. An administrator resets a password from the same Manage Users dialog, which also signs the user out of all of their existing sessions.
:::

Deleting a local user prevents them from signing in again, but it does not delete the Obot user account they created by signing in. Delete that from the Users page, as you would for any other user.

### GitHub

You will need to create an OAuth App in GitHub following these [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app).

You can view the source code for GitHub provider in this [repo](https://github.com/obot-platform/tools).

### Google

Follow the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server#creatingcred) to create the OAuth app for Obot.

You can view the source code for Google provider in this [repo](https://github.com/obot-platform/tools).

### Entra (Enterprise Only)

Within the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com), go to App registrations and click New registration.

Under Supported account types, ensure `Accounts in this organizational directory only` is selected. In the Redirect URI section, set the platform to `Web` and enter the redirect URI provided in Obot's Auth Provider configuration dialog.

![screenshot of Entra App registration](/img/entra-app-registration.png)

After completing the form, click Register.

Next, go to the API permissions tab and add the following **delegated** permissions:

- `User.Read`
- `ProfilePhoto.Read.All` *requires admin approval*

Then add the following **application** permissions:

- `GroupMember.Read.All` *requires admin approval*
- `User.Read.All` *requires admin approval*

After all permissions are approved, your App's Configured permissions section should look something like this:

![screenshot of Entra configured permissions](/img/entra-new-configured-permissions.png)

Head to the Certificates & secrets tab and click New Client secret.
Select a desired expiration date and click `Add`.

Copy the exposed secret from the `Value` column to a safe location. You will not be able to retrieve the secret value after this point.

![screenshot of Entra client secret](/img/entra-client-secret.png)

Finally, navigate to the Overview tab and copy the values of `Application (client) ID` and `Directory (tenant) ID` for reference.

You can now return to Obot and finish configuring Entra. Use the table below to determine the values to use for each field:

| Obot          | Entra                   | Entra App Tab          |
|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Client ID     | Application (client) ID | Overview               |
| Client Secret | Secret `Value` column   | Certificates & secrets |
| Tenant ID     | Directory (tenant) ID   | Overview               |

#### Restricting Login to Specific Users and Groups (Optional)

You can restrict login access to specific Entra users and groups by taking the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com)
2. Select `Enterprise apps`, then select `All applications`
3. Select the application corresponding to your Obot instance
4. On the application's `Overview` page, under the `Manage` section, select `Properties`
5. Toggle the `Assignment required?` setting to `Yes`
6. Select `Save` in the top bar
7. Under `Manage`, select `Users and Groups` and then select `Add user/group`
8. Search for and add the desired Entra users and groups to the application

For more details, [see Entra's docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/howto-restrict-your-app-to-a-set-of-users).

### Okta (Enterprise Only)

:::note
Only the org-level authorization server is supported (no custom authorization servers).
:::

Create an OAuth app of type `OIDC` in Okta following these [instructions](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-oauth-for-okta/main/#create-an-oauth-2-0-app-in-okta).
Make sure to add the redirect URL displayed in Obot to the list of Sign-in redirect URIs in your Okta application settings.

Take note of the Client ID and Client Secret. You will need to provide these to Obot.

Next, create another OAuth app, this time of type `API Services`. Grant it the API scopes `okta.users.read` and `okta.groups.read`.
Assign an administrator role to this app that has, at a minimum, `okta.users.read` and `okta.groups.read` permissions.
You can use an existing administrator role (such as Read-Only Administrator), or create a custom one.

Next, change the client authentication method on your API Services app from `Client secret` to `Public key / Private key`.
Then, add a new key to your app. Ensure that your app has only one key in total. You can generate the key on your own,
or have Okta do it for you. Make sure you save the private key in PEM format, as you will need to provide that to Obot,
in addition to the Client ID for this app. When you are done with that, the `Client Credentials` section should look similar to this:

![Okta API Services App Client Credentials configuration](/img/okta-client-credentials.png)

#### Restricting Login to Specific Users and Groups (Optional)

You can restrict login access to specific Okta users and groups by taking the following steps:

1. While creating the `OIDC` App for Obot, select the `Skip group assignment for now` option in the `Assignments` configuration section
2. After the App is created, go to the App's configuration page
3. In the `Assignments` tab, click on the `Assign` button and select `Assign to Groups` in the dropdown menu
4. Select `Assign` on groups you want to allow Obot access to
5. Once you've made your selections, click `Done`

### JumpCloud (Enterprise Only)

Create a **Custom OIDC App** in the [JumpCloud Admin Portal](https://console.jumpcloud.com/). When configuring the app:

1. Set the **Redirect URI / Callback URL** to the redirect URI displayed in Obot's Auth Provider configuration dialog
2. Ensure the application can issue the scopes `openid`, `email`, `profile`, and `offline_access`
3. Take note of the app's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Configure the app to include group membership claims:
   - Enable **Include Group Attribute** and set the exact attribute name to `memberOf`. This is required for group-based authorization in Obot.
   - Set group assignment to **User groups assigned to this app**
5. Assign the JumpCloud user groups that should be allowed to sign in to this application. Users who are not assigned to the app through a group assignment will not be able to log in.

You will also need JumpCloud management API credentials for JumpCloud management API access. These credentials are separate from the OIDC app credentials used for login.

Obot uses the JumpCloud management API to:

- look up the authenticated JumpCloud system user
- verify the user is active and not suspended
- list JumpCloud user groups for admin selection
- map OIDC `memberOf` claim values to known JumpCloud groups

You must provide one of the following in the Obot Auth Provider configuration:

- a JumpCloud service account client ID and client secret. This is the preferred option for JumpCloud group lookup and assignment in Obot.
- or an API key with access to read users and user groups

If you use a service account:

1. Create a JumpCloud API service account for Obot in the JumpCloud admin console
2. Generate or reveal its **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Read-only permissions are sufficient

If you use service-account credentials and your JumpCloud region requires a different admin OAuth endpoint, override the token URL in Obot as well.

You can now return to Obot and finish configuring JumpCloud. Use the table below to determine the values to use for each field:

| Obot                         | JumpCloud |
|------------------------------|-----------|
| Client ID                    | OIDC app Client ID |
| Client Secret                | OIDC app Client Secret |
| Service Account Client ID    | JumpCloud service account client ID. Preferred instead of `API Key`. |
| Service Account Client Secret| JumpCloud service account client secret. Preferred instead of `API Key`. |
| API Key                      | Admin Portal API key. Required if `Service Account Client ID` and `Service Account Client Secret` are not configured. |
| Service Account Token URL (Optional) | Optional admin OAuth token endpoint. Defaults to `https://admin-oauth.id.jumpcloud.com/oauth2/token`. |
| Issuer URL (Optional)        | Optional OIDC issuer URL. Defaults to `https://oauth.id.jumpcloud.com/`. |
| API Base URL (Optional)      | Optional JumpCloud API base URL. Defaults to `https://console.jumpcloud.com`; use `https://console.eu.jumpcloud.com` for EU tenants. |

:::important Account Status Requirement
The JumpCloud user must resolve to an active, non-suspended JumpCloud system user. Suspended or inactive users will be blocked from logging in.
:::

### Auth0 (Enterprise Only)

Create a **Regular Web Application** in the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com) by navigating to Applications > Applications > Create Application.

In the application's Settings tab:

1. Set the **Allowed Callback URLs** to the redirect URI displayed in Obot's Auth Provider configuration dialog
2. Take note of the **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret**

:::important Email Verification
Auth0 users must have a verified email address to log in to Obot. If a user's email is not verified, the login will fail with a 500 error.

You can verify a user's email in the Auth0 Dashboard under **User Management > Users** by selecting the user and confirming their email is marked as verified. Alternatively, ensure your Auth0 connection is configured to automatically verify emails.

If your Auth0 tenant does not support email verification (e.g. certain social or enterprise connections), you can set the `OBOT_AUTH0_AUTH_PROVIDER_INSECURE_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_EMAIL` configuration option to `true` in the Auth Provider configuration dialog. Note that this weakens account and email-domain validation.
:::

You can now return to Obot and finish configuring Auth0. Use the table below to determine the values to use for each field:

| Obot          | Auth0         | Auth0 Dashboard Location |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Auth0 Domain  | Domain        | Application Settings     |
| Client ID     | Client ID     | Application Settings     |
| Client Secret | Client Secret | Application Settings     |

#### Machine to Machine Application

A **Machine to Machine** application is required for Obot to read user and role information from Auth0.

Create one in the Auth0 Dashboard by navigating to Applications > Applications > Create Application and selecting **Machine to Machine**.

1. Authorize the app for the **Auth0 Management API** with the following scopes:
   - `read:users`
   - `read:roles`
   - `read:role_members`
2. Take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for this application

Use the table below to determine the values to use for each field in Obot's Auth Provider configuration dialog:

| Obot                        | Auth0         | Auth0 Dashboard Location |
|-----------------------------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Machine to Machine Client ID     | Client ID     | Application Settings     |
| Machine to Machine Client Secret | Client Secret | Application Settings     |

#### Restricting Login to Specific Users (Optional)

You can restrict which users can log in to Obot through Auth0 using connection-level access control or organizations.

##### Using Connection-Level Access Control

You can limit which Auth0 connections (identity providers) are allowed to log in to Obot.

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to **Applications > Applications**
2. Select your Obot application
3. Open the **Connections** tab
4. Disable any connections that should not be allowed to log in to Obot
5. Leave enabled only the connections for users who should have access

##### Using Auth0 Organizations

If your Auth0 tenant supports [Organizations](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/organizations), you can restrict access to users who belong to specific organizations.

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, navigate to **Organizations**
2. Create a new organization
3. Add the desired users as members
4. Under the organization's **Connections** tab, enable the connections users should use to log in
5. In **Applications > Applications**, select your Obot application
6. Open the **Organizations** tab and configure the application to require organization membership

## Switching Between Auth Providers

This section describes the steps involved in switching authentication providers in Obot. In this example, the provider is switched from **GitHub** to **Microsoft Entra**.

### Prerequisites

- Authentication is already enabled.
- GitHub is configured as the active authentication provider.
- An initial **Owner** user is already set up.

### Step 1: Verify Bootstrap Login is Enabled

Ensure the following environment variable is set in your Obot installation:

`OBOT_SERVER_FORCE_ENABLE_BOOTSTRAP=true`

### Step 2: Deconfigure the Existing Auth Provider (GitHub)

1. Log in to the admin console (`<obot-server>/admin`).
2. Use the **Sign in with Bootstrap Token** option.

![screenshot of login with bootstrap and github](/img/login_bootstrap_and_github.png)

3. Enter the **Bootstrap Token** and click **Login**.
4. Navigate to **User Management → Auth Providers**.
5. In the configured provider (GitHub in this case), click **Deconfigure Provider**.

![screenshot of deconfigure authprovider option](/img/deconfigure_authprovider.png)

6. When prompted for confirmation, click **Yes, I'm sure**.

![screenshot of deconfigure authprovider confirmation](/img/deconfigure_authprovider_confirmation.png)

7. After deconfiguration, you are redirected to the **Welcome to Obot!** page.

![screenshot of welcome obot](/img/welcome_obot_bootstrap.png)

### Step 3: Configure Microsoft Entra as the New Auth Provider

1. On the **Welcome to Obot!** page, click **Get Started**.
2. You are redirected to the **Auth Providers** page.
3. Locate **Microsoft Entra** and click **Configure**.

![screenshot of setup entra](/img/setup_entra.png)

4. Follow the documentation to create and configure the Entra application from [Entra Instructions](#entra-enterprise-only).
5. Enter the required details:
- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Tenant ID
6. Click **Confirm**.
7. Log out.

### Step 4: Log In Using Microsoft Entra

1. Log in to the Obot server (`<obot-server>`).
2. Authenticate using your Microsoft Entra credentials.
3. After successful authentication, a user with the default role is created.
4. Log out.

### Step 5: Promote the Entra User to Owner
1. Log in to the admin console (`<obot-server>/admin`).
2. Click **Sign in with Bootstrap Token**.

![screenshot of login with bootstrap and entra](/img/login_bootstrap_and_entra.png)

3. Authenticate using the Bootstrap token.
4. Navigate to **User Management → Users**.
5. Locate the Entra user account created in the previous step.
6. Click **Update Role** and change the role to **Owner**.
7. Log out.

### Step 6: Final Verification
1. Log in to the Obot server (`<obot-server>`).
2. Click **Continue with Microsoft Entra**.
3. Sign in using the Entra user account that was promoted to Owner in Step 5.
4. You should now be logged in successfully as an **Owner**.

:::note
User identities are scoped to the authentication provider used during login.
If a user previously authenticated using GitHub later signs in using Entra with the same email address, Obot creates a new user record.
As a result, multiple user accounts with the same email address may exist when authentication providers are switched.
