title: MCP Server GitOps
---

## Overview

Obot supports managing MCP servers through Git repositories, enabling GitOps workflows. Instead of manually adding MCP servers one at a time, administrators can source server configurations from Git repositories. This supports collaborative workflows with proper code review, versioning, and automated validation processes.

### Key Benefits

- **Version Control**: Change tracking, rollback capabilities, and branch-based development
- **Collaborative Workflows**: PR-based reviews, team collaboration, and approval processes
- **Validation & Quality Assurance**: Automated testing, CI/CD integration, and consistent formatting
- **Automation**: Integration with existing DevOps workflows and automated deployment

## Getting Started

1. **Create or Fork a Repository**: Start with the official [Obot MCP server repository](https://github.com/obot-platform/mcp-catalog) or create your own
2. **Add Server Configurations**: Create YAML files for each MCP server following the format below
3. **Configure Obot**: Point your Obot instance to the Git repository containing your server configurations
4. **Establish Review Workflows**: Set up branch protection rules and PR-based review processes for configuration changes
5. **Automate Validation**: Implement CI/CD pipelines to validate YAML syntax and test server configurations

## Adding a Git Source URL

Administrators can add Git repositories as catalog sources from the **Admin → MCP Servers → Git Source URLs** tab. Click **Add server(s) from Git** and enter the repository URL.

:::note

Connection URLs for MCP servers are derived from catalog entry names. Git-synced catalog entries have deterministic names based on the repository and file path, so the connection URL remains the same even if you remove and re-add the Git repository.

:::

### Supported URL formats

| Platform | Example |
|---|---|
| GitHub | `https://github.com/org/repo` or `https://github.com/org/repo.git` |
| GitHub with branch | `https://github.com/org/repo/my-branch` |
| GitLab | `https://gitlab.com/org/repo` or `https://gitlab.com/org/repo.git` |
| GitLab with branch | `https://gitlab.com/org/repo/my-branch` |
| GitLab with subgroups | `https://gitlab.com/group/subgroup/repo.git` |
| Self-hosted | `https://git.example.com/org/repo.git` |

For GitHub and GitLab a `.git` suffix is optional. For self-hosted instances it is required. To specify a branch on GitHub or GitLab, append it after the repo name (e.g. `/my-branch`). GitLab subgroup repositories require the `.git` suffix to distinguish the subgroup path from a branch name.

### Private repositories

To pull from a private repository, enter a **Personal access token** in the optional field below the URL. The token is stored securely and never returned by the API after saving.

**Required token scopes:**

- **GitHub**: `repo` (read access is sufficient)
- **GitLab**: `read_repository` (clone access) + `read_api` (pre-clone size check)

If no per-URL token is configured, Obot falls back to the `GITHUB_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable.

## Configuration Format

MCP server configurations consist of individual YAML files, each defining a single MCP server. These files contain comprehensive metadata including:

- **Name and Description**: Human-readable identification
- **Tool Previews**: Documentation of available tools and their parameters
- **Metadata**: Categories, icons, repository URLs, and classification information
- **Environment Variables**: Required and optional configuration parameters
- **Resource Requirements**: Optional CPU and memory requests and limits for hosted server deployments
- **Runtime Configuration**: Deployment and connection details

For examples and reference implementations, see the official Obot MCP server repository at [github.com/obot-platform/mcp-catalog](https://github.com/obot-platform/mcp-catalog).

## YAML Configuration Structure

Each MCP server is defined in its own YAML file with the following structure:

### Basic Information

```yaml
entryKey: server-name # optional key for referencing in composite servers
name: Server Name
description: |
  Detailed description of the server's capabilities and features.
  Supports multi-line markdown formatting.
```

The optional `entryKey` field defines a stable key for this catalog entry. It must be unique within its source, DNS-friendly, and cannot contain `::`. This is used when [composite MCP servers](#composite-mcp-servers) need to reference entries without knowing Obot's generated internal catalog entry ID.

### Tool Previews

```yaml
toolPreview:
  - name: tool_name
    description: Description of what this tool does
    params:
      param1: Parameter description
      param2: Optional parameter description (optional)
```

### Metadata and Classification

```yaml
metadata:
  categories: Category Name, Another Category
  unsupportedTools: tool1,tool2  # Optional
icon: https://example.com/icon.png
repoURL: https://github.com/owner/repo
```

### Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  - key: ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE
    name: Human Readable Name
    required: true
    sensitive: true
    description: Description of this variable
```

### Server User Type

```yaml
serverUserType: singleUser  # Valid values: "singleUser" or "multiUser"
```

The `serverUserType` field specifies how users interact with the catalog entry:

- `singleUser`: Each user who installs this catalog entry gets their own independent MCP server instance.
- `multiUser`: The catalog entry is a template for shared multi-user deployments. An administrator or Power User+ deploys the template into a catalog or workspace, and users connect to that shared deployment through per-user MCP server instances.

Catalog entries should set this field explicitly. For compatibility with existing catalogs, some import paths normalize an omitted value to `singleUser` before validation. Any persisted value other than `singleUser` or `multiUser` is rejected at validation time.

Multi-user catalog templates support the `npx`, `uvx`, `containerized`, and `remote` runtimes. They do not support the `composite` runtime.

### Composite MCP servers

Composite MCP servers combine tools from other catalog entries. In GitOps, composite entries can reference component entries in three ways:

- Use a normal internal `catalogEntryID`, such as `default-gmail-8a99d8be`
- Use a same-source portable key with `{entryKey}`. The target entry must define `entryKey` and must be in the same source.
- Use a cross-source portable key with `{sourceID}::{entryKey}`. Obot uses the configured source URL without the `https://` prefix as `sourceID`. For example, `https://github.com/company/mcp-catalog` is referenced as `github.com/company/mcp-catalog`. The target entry must define `entryKey`.

Portable references are useful when the target entry is in the same Git catalog sync and does not have an internal generated ID yet, or when you want to use a purely-gitops workflow.

```yaml
name: Gmail Composite
runtime: composite
compositeConfig:
  componentServers:
    - catalogEntryID: gmail
    - catalogEntryID: github.com/company/mcp-catalog::gmail
```

During sync, Obot resolves portable keys to internal generated catalog entry IDs and stores the internal IDs. If `catalogEntryID` does not contain `::` and does not match an `entryKey` in the same source, Obot treats it as an internal catalog entry ID and leaves it unchanged.

#### Composite configuration fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `compositeConfig.componentServers` | Yes | List of component servers included in the composite server. |
| `componentServers[].catalogEntryID` | Yes, unless `mcpServerID` is set | Catalog entry reference. This can be an internal catalog entry ID, same-source `entryKey`, or cross-source `{sourceID}::{entryKey}`. |
| `componentServers[].mcpServerID` | Yes, unless `catalogEntryID` is set | Existing deployed MCP server to include as a component. Use this when a composite should include a multi-user server that has already been deployed. |
| `componentServers[].toolPrefix` | No | Prefix added to every exposed tool from this component after any `overrideName` is applied. For example, `configured_` turns `echo` into `configured_echo`. |
| `componentServers[].toolOverrides` | No | Tool allowlist and customization list. If omitted, all tools from the component are exposed. If present, only tools listed with `enabled: true` are exposed; tools not listed are hidden. |
| `componentServers[].toolOverrides[].name` | Yes | Original tool name returned by the component server. |
| `componentServers[].toolOverrides[].enabled` | No | Whether this tool is exposed by the composite server. Defaults to `false`, so set `enabled: true` for every tool you want to expose. |
| `componentServers[].toolOverrides[].overrideName` | No | Replacement tool name before `toolPrefix` is applied. If omitted, the original `name` is used. |
| `componentServers[].toolOverrides[].overrideDescription` | No | Replacement tool description. Use this for custom tool text in Git-managed catalogs. |
| `componentServers[].toolOverrides[].description` | No | Reserved for Obot's live/source tool metadata and rejected in Git-synced tool overrides. Use `overrideDescription` instead. |

To get `mcpServerID` for an existing deployed multi-tenant server, open the server in Obot, choose **Connect URL**, and copy the path segment after `/mcp-connect/`. For example, if the connect URL is `https://obot.example.com/mcp-connect/ms1qc7nz`, use `ms1qc7nz` as `mcpServerID`.

When `toolOverrides` is present, it acts as an allowlist. This means adding a tool to the list without `enabled: true` disables that tool, and also hides any other component tools that are not listed. To disable only a few tools, list those disabled tools and also list every tool you still want exposed with `enabled: true`. To rename or redescribe a tool while keeping it available, include `enabled: true`.

This does not expose `web_search_exa`:

```yaml
name: Research Search Composite
runtime: composite
compositeConfig:
  componentServers:
    - catalogEntryID: github.com/obot-platform/mcp-catalog::obot-exa-search
      toolOverrides:
        - name: web_search_exa
```

Because `enabled` defaults to `false`, that component exposes no tools. Set `enabled: true` for each tool that should be available:

```yaml
name: Research Search Composite
runtime: composite
compositeConfig:
  componentServers:
    - catalogEntryID: github.com/obot-platform/mcp-catalog::obot-exa-search
      toolPrefix: research_
      toolOverrides:
        - name: web_search_exa
          enabled: true
          overrideName: web_search
          overrideDescription: Search the web for current research and source material.
        - name: company_research_exa
          enabled: true
          overrideName: company_research
          overrideDescription: Find company information and market context.
        - name: crawling_exa
          enabled: false
```

This example exposes `research_web_search` and `research_company_research`, and hides `crawling_exa`. Because `toolOverrides` is an allowlist, any other tools from the Exa component are also hidden unless they are listed with `enabled: true`.

#### Multi-user template with shared configuration

Use `serverUserType: multiUser` when the catalog entry should create a shared deployment instead of one server per user. Deployment-level configuration, such as shared credentials, is configured on the deployed server.

```yaml
name: Shared Weather
description: Shared weather API server for the organization.
serverUserType: multiUser
runtime: uvx
uvxConfig:
  package: weather-mcp-server
env:
  - key: WEATHER_API_KEY
    name: Weather API Key
    required: true
    sensitive: true
    description: Shared API key configured on the deployed multi-user server.
```

#### Per-user headers for multi-user deployments

If each user must provide values after connecting to the shared deployment, define `multiUserConfig.userDefinedHeaders`. These values are stored on the user's MCP server instance and sent through the gateway for that user's requests.

```yaml
name: Shared Internal API
description: Shared multi-user server with per-user request headers.
serverUserType: multiUser
runtime: remote
remoteConfig:
  fixedURL: https://api.example.com/mcp
multiUserConfig:
  userDefinedHeaders:
    - key: X-User-Token
      name: User Token
      required: true
      sensitive: true
      description: Personal token used by the upstream service for this user.
```

### Resource Requirements

Catalog entries can optionally define CPU and memory requests and limits for hosted MCP server deployments. These values are useful when a specific server needs more or fewer resources than the platform defaults.

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: 250m
    memory: 512Mi
  limits:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: 1Gi
```

Supported fields are:

- `resources.requests.cpu`
- `resources.requests.memory`
- `resources.limits.cpu`
- `resources.limits.memory`

Values use standard Kubernetes resource quantity syntax, such as `250m`, `1`, `512Mi`, or `1Gi`.

When omitted, Obot uses the configured MCP server resource defaults. When specified, catalog entry resource values override the corresponding default request or limit for servers created from that catalog entry.

If the Kubernetes runtime has MCP resource maximums configured, catalog entry resource values must be less than or equal to those maximums when the entry is created, updated, or refreshed from Git. If a previously-created MCP server already exceeds the current maximums, users can still connect to it, but configuration changes to that server must lower the resources below the maximums.

### Kubernetes Secret Bindings

Secret bindings let you wire an env var, header, or file to a key in an externally-managed Kubernetes Secret instead of asking the user to supply the value at install time.

Secret bindings are only available when Obot is using the Kubernetes MCP runtime backend.

The referenced Kubernetes Secret must be in the Obot server namespace and must have the [configured allowed secret-binding label](./server-configuration.md).

Obot checks this label when resolving bound values. If the Secret is missing the label, the binding is treated the same as a missing Secret or key. Required bound fields are reported as missing configuration.

#### Basic env var binding

The resolved value is injected into the MCP server pod as an environment variable — this works for `npx`, `uvx`, and `containerized` runtimes (not `remote`, which uses header bindings instead).

```yaml
env:
  - key: API_KEY
    name: API Key
    required: true
    sensitive: true
    description: Bound to a pre-existing Kubernetes Secret — no user input needed.
    secretBinding:
      name: my-secret       # Kubernetes Secret name
      key: api_key          # Key within that Secret
```

**Constraints:**
- Not supported for `remote` runtime env vars (use a header binding instead).
- `required: false` is allowed — when the Secret or key is absent the server deploys without that env var.
- For `remoteConfig.urlTemplate`, `${VAR}` placeholders must not reference env vars that use `secretBinding`.
- Do not set `secretBinding.adminAdded` in Git catalog YAML. Obot sets this field only on deployed servers for admin-selected bindings.

#### File binding

When `file: true` the secret value is written to a file under `/files/` and the env var is set to the file path. This is useful for secrets that applications expect to read from the filesystem.

```yaml
env:
  - key: TLS_CERT
    name: TLS Certificate
    file: true
    required: true
    sensitive: true
    description: PEM certificate; mounted as a file at the path stored in TLS_CERT.
    secretBinding:
      name: my-tls-secret
      key: tls.crt
```

The application reads the certificate path from `os.Getenv("TLS_CERT")` and opens the file at that path.

#### Dynamic file binding

Adding `dynamicFile: true` (requires `file: true`) allows the mounted file to update **without restarting the pod** when the source Kubernetes Secret changes. The application is responsible for watching/re-reading the file for changes. This only has an effect when `file: true`.

```yaml
env:
  - key: API_CREDENTIALS
    name: API Credentials File
    file: true
    dynamicFile: true
    required: true
    sensitive: true
    description: Credentials file updated in-place when the Secret rotates — no pod restart needed.
    secretBinding:
      name: rotating-api-creds
      key: credentials.json
```

**Constraints:**
- `dynamicFile` is ignored unless `file: true`.
- `file` and `dynamicFile` are not supported on header bindings.

#### Header binding (remote servers)

For `remote` runtime servers, bind an outbound HTTP header to a Kubernetes Secret key:

```yaml
runtime: remote
remoteConfig:
  fixedURL: https://api.example.com/mcp
  headers:
    - key: Authorization
      name: API Token
      required: true
      sensitive: true
      secretBinding:
        name: api-token-secret
        key: token
```

### Runtime Configuration

For remote servers:

```yaml
runtime: remote
remoteConfig:
  hostname: api.example.com
  fixedURL: https://api.example.com/mcp  # Alternative to hostname
  headers:
    - name: Authorization Header
      description: API token description
      key: Authorization
      required: true
      sensitive: true
```

For local packages:

```yaml
runtime: uvx
uvxConfig:
  package: 'package-name@latest'
```
