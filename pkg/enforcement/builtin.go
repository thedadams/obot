// builtinAgentMCPServers is the explicit, per-agent set of MCP server names that
// ship inside the agent itself (as opposed to servers a user configures). A call
// to one of these is what the "Allow all built-in agent MCP servers" coarse
// toggle permits.
//
// Membership is intentionally kept out of any user-facing copy and is expected
// to be curated over time as agents add or rename their built-in servers. The
// evaluator's behavior does not depend on the exact contents of this map.
