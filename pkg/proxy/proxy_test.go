// The staged provider is allowed to beat the session's provider only for a browser carrying an

// without the cookie the answer must be "no staged provider" regardless of what is staged, so an
// ordinary request can never be routed to a replacement that is not serving logins yet.
//
// The remaining conditions -- that something is staged, and that the cookie names an open
// verification -- run through the dispatcher, and LoginableAuthProvider is tested against them in
